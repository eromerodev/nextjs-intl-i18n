# Next.js internationalization (i18n)

Next.js provides built-in support for internationalization (i18n), which allows you to create applications that can be easily adapted to multiple languages and locales. Internationalization generally involves translating user interface strings and adjusting features like date and number formatting based on the user's locale.

The next-intl library is a handy tool for internationalization (i18n) in Next.js applications. Using the `@next-intl/plugin`, you can simplify the translation management workflow.
